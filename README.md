## About Me

I’m Jeff G., a web app dev, website designer, and creator of a custom freelance video scripting engine I simply call **my system**.
Thousands of hours, countless iterations, and razor-sharp focus have shaped it into a content-creation powerhouse: from barebones ideas to viral-ready scripts tailored for your niche, audience, and platform.

When creativity stalls or burnout hits, **my system** fuels your pipeline with ideas, scripts, rewrites, monetization strategies, and follow-up concepts — all designed to cut through noise and build real audience connection.
