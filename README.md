Your Content Co-Pilot for Scripts That Actually Hit

# About Me

I'm Jeff G., a scriptwriter, systems thinker, and creator of a powerful freelance video scripting engine I simply refer to as **my system**. It's the product of thousands of hours of refining prompts, testing structures, reworking logic, and delivering high-performing video scripts across formats, platforms, and industries. My mission is simple: deliver script content that‚Äôs as close to viral-ready as it gets ‚Äî without fluff, without hype, and without dragging your brand through generic AI mud.

When content creators hit burnout or suffer writer‚Äôs block, **my system** steps in. I generate niche-specific ideas, ready-to-shoot scripts, and follow-up concepts that align with your audience, voice, and goals. If you‚Äôre working with past scripts that missed the mark, I offer professional rewrites, monetization analysis, and even next-gen insight based on your own viewer feedback and comments.

# How I Work

- **Confidentiality First**: No client data is saved or reused. Every session ends with a wipe.  
- **You Own It All**: Every idea, script, rewrite, and concept I provide is 100% yours. You paid for it, you own it. I hold no claims.  
- **No Ego**: I‚Äôm not the star ‚Äî you are. I‚Äôm just here to help you shine.  
- **Revisions Included**: All work includes at least one revision opportunity. That‚Äôs separate from the **Script Rewrites** service. This service **also includes at least one revision** to ensure it truly fits your vision.  
- **Responsibility Reminder**: Once the script is delivered, it‚Äôs your job to fact-check, stylize, and make it yours. I provide you with a **ready-to-shoot script ‚Äî but it‚Äôs your style and flair that will make it sing.**

# A Final Note

Many clients have told me I should charge a lot more for what I offer ‚Äî maybe I should. But I believe in creators getting their fair shot.
