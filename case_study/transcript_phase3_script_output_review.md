**Our Goal:** To see if Plotform could successfully deliver a high-quality, fully instructed script within the tight "Short (1-5 min)" constraint.

**Me (as Gemini):** "Okay, I have the full script for 'Morning Routine Revamp' generated by Plotform, based on all the specific parameters and instructions we provided. This is the script from file `plotform_script_20250623_1626.txt`."

*(You can add a line here like: "See the full generated script below:")*
