My system is custom-built and constantly evolving
I've engineered it from scratch through trial, sweat, and absurd persistence
Itâ€™s currently being rewritten in Vue and FastAPI for scalability, UI improvements, and smoother customer experience
While part of my process is software-assisted, **every client output is reviewed, tailored, and finalized by me**
