Confidentiality First: No client data is saved or reused. Every session ends with a wipe.
You Own It All: Every idea, script, rewrite, and concept I provide is 100% yours. You paid for it, you own it. I hold no claims.
No Ego: I’m not the star — you are. I’m just here to help you shine.
Revisions Included: All work includes at least one revision opportunity. That’s separate from the Script Rewrites service. This service also includes at least one revision to ensure it truly fits your vision.
Responsibility Reminder: Once the script is delivered, it’s your job to fact-check, stylize, and make it yours. I provide you with a **ready-to-shoot script** — but it’s your style and flair that will make it sing.
